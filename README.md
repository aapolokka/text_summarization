# Text Summarization project

## Introduction

This project is used to summarize text between two sections in PDF. For example, you can summarize long introductions or conclusions of research papers to help decide whether the paper is useful for you or not. 

## How to use 

Code is run from terminal. To run code you need input pdf-file, and the section names that you use to summarize text. The different options to run code can be found by using command `-h` or `--help`:
```
python summarize_text.py -h
```
For example, to summarize first section from included test pdf (generated by using ChatGPT).

```
python summarize_text.py -f test.pdf -s 'Section 1' -e 'Section 2'
```
## Used external packages

For production use, these can (and probably should) be incorporated into the environment build.
